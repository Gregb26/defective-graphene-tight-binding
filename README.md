# defective-graphene-tight-binding
Computing the matrix elements of the electron-defect interaction in defective graphene using the tight binding model in the Wannier basis. The analysis is in defective_graphene_tight_binding.ipynb and the helper functions are in the directory utils/.

Some many-body quantities like the non-interacting Green's function, the T-matrix, the interacting Green's function and the spectral function are computed.
